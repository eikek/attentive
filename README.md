# Attentive

A personal scrobble daemon.

This project is a minimal scrobble server that can collect what songs
you are listening to. It's similiar to services like libre.fm or
last.fm, but without the social/community thing. The idea of attentive
is to be a simple and lightweight scrobble daemon that could run on a
raspberry pi or similiar devices at home.
